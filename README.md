　　新结识了朋友，感觉志趣心性都相近，大有相见恨晚的惺惺相惜之感。于是，便借朋友空间为桥梁，伶伶俐俐、轻轻巧巧进入其空间看了几次。每去一次，内心都有一份感慨：人生何处不相逢。
　　大跃进连着三年自然灾害，人祸伴着天灾，将整个中国都折腾得筋疲力尽了。粮食没了，就挖野菜，和着苞米阳子磨成的淀粉，做成饽饽，顿顿充饥，好吃不好吃的，能吃不能吃的，都往肚子里忙活。那时候的人们，睁开眼睛是饿，闭上眼睛还是饿，眼睛饿的娇蓝，肚子饿的稀瘪。走路那个费劲啊，上坡往后仰，下坡往前张。那时人们的追求，已不再是什么大跃进人民公社了，现实得只要能吃上一顿净面饽饽，就算满足了。哪怕吃完了就撑死，也值！人们的日常生活，也多半是在围绕如何活命而展开……
　　前不久，我去坐公共交通车，车上人很多，我就握着扶把站在过道上，跟着车子动摇的节拍在何处闲逛。过程一站时，上去一个老爷爷，他一步一摇往前挪。遽然，一其中年妇女从位子上站出来，说：“老辈子，来，你坐。”老翁家也没和她谦和几个循环，便放释怀心底坐上去了。我不过很随便地望了谁人姨妈一眼，只见她脸上是一脸的轻快，没有任何承担。又是遽然的一下，我本质磅礴起来，连接问本人，一部分明显无故端遗失一个位子，干什么是一脸轻快，一脸澄清?
Nearly evening, grandpa or grandson went to embrace a embrace wood wood bar, thick chestnut wood, wood density, stand to burn.
The mountain's, people used to sit beside the fireplace, is as natural as breathing.
